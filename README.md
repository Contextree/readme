# ðŸŒ³ Context Tree

![Context Tree Banner](https://placehold.co/800x200/222/FFF?text=Context%20Tree)

**Context Tree** is a **visual, node-based platform** designed to build, debug, and manage complex conversational AI applications.  
It transforms the often-opaque process of building **LLM-powered chatbots** into a **transparent, collaborative, and intuitive experience**.  

By externalizing conversational logic into a **visual graph**, developers, prompt engineers, and designers can precisely **control LLM behavior**, **manage conversation state**, and **experiment safely** â€” all without touching production code.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Visual Graph Editor**  
  Design conversation flows with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.  
  Connect user messages, bot responses, context data, LLM calls, and more.  

- **Explicit Context Management**  
  Link RAG results, API data, and conversation summaries directly to LLM calls.  
  See real-time previews of the **exact prompt** that will be sent to the model.  

- **Powerful Versioning & Branching**  
  Fork conversations from any point.  
  Test new prompts, explore alternative paths, and debug without breaking the main flow.  

- **Interactive Simulation & Debugging**  
  Step through conversations to observe model behavior.  
  Use interactive chat mode to trace conversation paths in real-time.  

- **Collaboration & Sharing**  
  Share graphs, add comments on nodes, and collaborate with your team seamlessly.  

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Built with **React**, **FastAPI**, and **Python** (optionally with **LangGraph**) for scalable logic and integrations.
